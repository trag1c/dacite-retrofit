# dacite-retrofit

A [dacite][dacite-repo] fork with [PEP 585][pep-585] & [PEP 604][pep-604] typehint
support in Python 3.8+. See the original project for documentation.

## Installation

`dacite-retrofit` is available on PyPI:
```
pip install dacite-retrofit
```

It can also be installed from source:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/trag1c/dacite-retrofit.git
```

> **Warning**
> Unlike `dacite` (which supports Python 3.6+), `dacite-retrofit` only supports
> Python 3.8+.

> **Note**
> If you are still using Python version older than 3.8, something in your life needs urgent reconsideration.<br />
> Maybe it's time to move on?

## Development
This fork uses `poetry`, `black`, `mypy` and `isort`:
```console
$ poetry run black .
$ poetry run mypy dacite
$ poetry run isort .
```
